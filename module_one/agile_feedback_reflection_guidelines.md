# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

  - I have learned that the use of Agile development practices are better for a group. We were able to continuiously improve and catch problems earlier on.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

  - We created a slack channel and used that mainly for communication. we were able to clearly identify what our problem areas were and were our project could use some improvements. We held eachother accountable by having clear deadlines and being sure to reach out if one of us were stuck.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 

  - I was able to help mostly with the overall structure of our classes and data, and helping everyone grasp a clearer understanding of hashes in general. 

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?

  - GITHUB. We had to do the project at least twice in its entirety due to a collective poor use of git. 

5. How does retro function in a team project?

  - We found our daily retros super helpful in gauging exactly where we were at through every step of the project. It was helpful in keeping us on track as a team.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

  - We were always honest with eachother first and foremost. Being honest is paramount in managing the expectations of others. 

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

  - I think in the future I will continue to add more fluff to my feedback so I don't come off as abrasive.
